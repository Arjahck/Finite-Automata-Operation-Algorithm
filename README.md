## Disclaimer

This project was done in Codeblocks (can result to missing file error when run by another application).
Most of the files names, variable names and commentary is in french.

## Working exemple

1) Reading an automaton in a file

Line 1: Initial_Status
Line 2: the state or states that are initial
Line 3: End_Status
Line 4: the state or states that are final/terminal
Line 5: Alphabet
Line 6: characters of the alphabet
Line 7: Automaton
Line 8: Transitions
â€¦
Line 10: END
In a .txt file, we wrote the automaton as indicated in the statement.
